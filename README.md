This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://0.0.0.0:3000](http://0.0.0.0:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Great news! Your local Supabase backend is fully set up and ready for development. Here's a quick summary of what we've accomplished:

*   **Supabase CLI:** We installed the Supabase CLI locally in your project to manage the environment.
*   **Local Backend:** A complete Supabase stack (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, etc.) is now running locally on your machine via Docker.
*   **Database Schema:** Your database has been successfully set up with the `database-schema.sql` we created. The schema is now stored in `supabase/seed.sql` and is automatically applied.
*   **Application Connection:** I've guided you on how to create the `.env.local` file with the necessary credentials to connect your Next.js app to this local backend.

### Your Local Supabase Credentials

For your reference, here are the details for your local environment. These are the same details you placed in your `.env.local` file.

*   **API URL:** `http://0.0.0.0:54321`
*   **Anon Key:** `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZS1kZW1vIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJleHAiOjE5ODM4MTI5OTZ9.CRXP1A7WOeoJeXxjNni43kdQwgnWNReilDMblYTn_I0`
*   **Database URL:** `postgresql://postgres:postgres@0.0.0.0:54322/postgres`
*   **Supabase Studio:** You can visually manage your local database by visiting `http://0.0.0.0:54323` in your browser.

### Next Steps

1.  **Run Your App:** If you haven't already, make sure your Next.js development server is running.
    ```bash
    # From the content-calendar-saas directory
    npm run dev -- --port 3001
    ```
2.  **Test Authentication:** Visit the `/login` page in your application. You should now be able to sign up and log in, and the data will be stored in your local Supabase database. Check the Dashboard page to see if your user data is displayed correctly.
3.  **Explore Supabase Studio:** Open `http://0.0.0.0:54323` to see the new users and data appear in your database tables as you use the application.

This completes the setup of your local backend. Your Content Calendar SaaS now has a fully functional, integrated backend for development. Let me know if you have any other questions!
