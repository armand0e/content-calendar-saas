- ✅ Created `.env.local.example` template
- ✅ Added setup instructions in `QUICK_START.md`
- ✅ Removed deprecated `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` package
- ✅ Application runs successfully on `localhost:3000`

  - Post status badges (draft, scheduled, published)
  - Platform indicators with icons

  - "Calendar" → `/calendar`
  - "Analytics" → `/analytics`
- ✅ **Sidebar Navigation** - Functional links in dashboard

- ✅ **Validation** - Minimum date is today (prevents past scheduling)

### **5. Placeholder Pages** ✅
- ✅ **Calendar Page** (`/calendar`) with:
  - Scheduled posts list view
  - Quick stats (this week, this month)
  - "Coming Soon" notice for drag-drop calendar
- ✅ **Analytics Page** (`/analytics`) with:

  - Recent posts performance
  - Platform performance placeholders
  - "Coming Soon" notice for advanced charts

### **6. UI Components & Design** ✅

## 🧪 **Testing Results**

### **✅ Verified Working Features:**
